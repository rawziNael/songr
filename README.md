Introduction to Spring MVC

Challenge
Use the Spring Initializr to create a new application with Web and Postgres dependencies.
Feature Tasks

Ensure that you can run the Spring app.
Create a hello world route at /hello, and ensure that you can visit that route in your browser and see data come back.
Create a route that turns words into UPPER CASE. For instance, I should be able to visit /capitalize/hello and get back the response HELLO, or I could visit /capitalize/this is Kinda Capitalized and get the response THIS IS KINDA CAPITALIZED.
Write a unit test for the capitalization functionality of that route.
